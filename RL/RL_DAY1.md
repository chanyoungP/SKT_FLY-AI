# Reinforcement Learning 

## 0. Introduction of RL 

### 1. Categories of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning (fully labeled)
- Semi-Supervised Learning (Partially labeled)
    - RL is here 
- Un-Supervised Learning 

### 2. RL Algorithms
- Model-free 
- Model-based 

### 3. Key point of RL 
- State 
- Actions
- Rewards 
    - Start with index 2 

### 4. Environments
- Fully observable Environments
    - like board game 
    - Markov Decision Process (MDP) known
- Partially observable Environments
    - Unknown MDP 

### 5. Components of an RL Agent
- Policy
    - compute next action of Agent
- Value function
    - compute how is good for long-term about action or state
- Model
